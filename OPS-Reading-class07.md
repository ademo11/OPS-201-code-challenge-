# What is PowerShell? **PowerShell** is a command-line shell interface made by Microsoft that enables system administrators and power users to manage computers from the command line. PowerShell is also a scripting language, built on .NET which can be used for automating administrative tasks and configuration management.

# PowerShell tasks are generally performed using **cmdlets** (pronounced command-lət) which can perform a wide variety of actions. These cmdlets can perform something as simple as evaluating the size of a file, to spinning up hundreds of servers in the cloud.

# PowerShell vs other languages
 # +  can be useful to show what PowerShell is by first showing what it is not. To do that, lets take a look at some of the most popular programming languages today:
 # +  JavaScript, Java, Pyton, c# and Ruby

# What’s in a **Shell**?
 # + Systems and Network Admins/Engineers will often gravitate towards a particular operating system, Linux or Windows. This may be based on personal preference, or because the environment they work in leverages one over the other. The following scenario typically unfolds as a result:

 # + Linux → Bash → Python
 # + Windows → PowerShell → C#

# This is changing now that Bash is available on Windows, and PowerShell is available on Linux. The lines are truly starting to blur, so lets explore these two languages.

# **PowerShell vs Bash**
# Bash is the shell primarily used in Linux.  # It combines a scripting language, as well   # as a host of native Linux tools to automate # and manage Linux devices. Lets take a look # at a PowerShell vs Bash comparison:


# Who needs malware? IBM says most hackers just PowerShell through boxes now, leaving little in the way of footprints
 # + A company's internal network, once compromised, is now more likely to be ransacked by automated scripts than a piece of malware.

 # + This according to researchers with IBM's # X-Force, who found that in 2018 just 43per cent of the attacks it analyzed utilized any sort of locally installed files. Rather, the hackers utilized PowerShell scripts to execute their dirty deeds in memory without significantly touching file systems, if at all.

# This finding is important because it is another reminder that admins can no longer solely rely on detecting malicious executables and similar data on hard drives and other storage, to identify cyber-intrusions.

# As with local malware infections, the attacker first needs to get the ability to run malicious commands. What differs is the next step, as the miscreant does not direct the infected Windows machine to download, save, and execute a trojan payload.
